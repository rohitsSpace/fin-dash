## Development Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions

1. **Component Structure**:

   - Each major dashboard section is implemented as a separate component
   - Charts use Chart.js with React wrappers
   - Styled-components are used for all styling

2. **Responsive Design**:

   - The layout uses a custom grid system based on styled-components
   - Breakpoints are set at standard screen sizes (sm, md, lg)
   - Cards and charts adapt to different container widths

3. **Accessibility**:

   - All interactive elements have proper ARIA attributes
   - Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Keyboard navigation is supported throughout

4. **Data Handling**:
   - Mock data is provided in `constants` files
   - No actual API calls are made in this demo version

### Design Assumptions

1. **User Experience**:

   - Users primarily view financial data at a glance
   - Horizontal scrolling is acceptable for card navigation, quick transfer
   - Vertical scrolling is supported in transaction
   - Interactive elements should provide visual feedback

2. **Visual Hierarchy**:

   - Cards are the primary content containers
   - Charts should be immediately understandable
   - Important actions are prominently displayed

3. **Performance**:
   - Charts are optimized to render efficiently
   - Scroll behavior is smooth and responsive
   - Minimal re-renders through available React practices

## Known Limitations

1. **Data Persistence**:

   - All data is mock data and resets on page refresh
   - No actual banking integration is implemented

2. **Browser Support**:

   - Optimized for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - IE11 is not supported

3. **Mobile Experience**:
   - Some charts may be less detailed on small screens
   - Horizontal scrolling might be less intuitive on touch devices

## Future Improvements

**Enhanced Features**:

- Add real API integration
- Implement user authentication
- Add more detailed transaction views
- Add other pages action items
- Test cases and coverage
